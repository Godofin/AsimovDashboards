# Operators has a method with we increment, decrement, comparar and test data in our computer

#Variables
data1 = 10
data2 = 10

# Math operators

addition = data1 + data2
subtraction = data1 - data2
divisor = data1 / data2
multiplication = data1 * data2

# Relational operator

equal = data1 == data2
different = data1 != data2
greaterThan = data1 > data2
lessThan = data1 < data2
greaterThanOrEqual = data1 >= data2
lessThanOrEqual = data1 <= data2

# Logical operator

logicalAnd = data1 & data2
logicalOr = data1 | data2
logicalNot = data1 != data2
